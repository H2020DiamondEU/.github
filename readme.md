# DIAMOND Horizon Project

The **DIAMOND Horizon Project** is an EU-funded initiative under the Horizon Europe program. It aims to revolutionize the field of photovoltaics by developing **ultra-stable, highly efficient, and low-cost solar cells** with a focus on minimizing environmental impact and maximizing sustainability.

## About the Project

DIAMOND is structured into comprehensive work packages, each targeting specific facets of perovskite photovoltaic (PV) technology:

- **Materials Optimization**: Enhancing absorber layers, hole and electron transport materials, and electrode deposition techniques to improve overall device performance.

- **High-Efficiency Solar Cells**: Achieving power conversion efficiencies (PCE) of ≥27%, stability over 5,000 hours for small-area perovskite solar cells (PSCs), reducing lead content, and optimizing carbon-based PSCs.

- **Module Development**: Developing scalable printing techniques for full-stack modules, aiming for carbon-based modules up to 100 cm² with PCE ≥18% and large-area modules up to 500 cm² with PCE ≥16%, fabricated outside glovebox environments.

- **Packaging & Encapsulation**: Implementing advanced laser-assisted sealing methods, polymeric sealing for PSC modules, and lead sequestration layers to enhance device longevity and safety.

- **Stability Assessment**: Evaluating material aging, intrinsic and extrinsic degradation mechanisms, and outdoor stability to ensure long-term performance.

- **Sustainability**: Conducting life cycle, techno-economic, and social assessments of PSC module production, focusing on low environmental impact, critical materials assessment, and design for recycling.
